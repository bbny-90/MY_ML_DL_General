# Implementation of nueral network based algorithms (for tensorflow and pytorch frameworks)

Implemeted models

- a simple message passing for graph conv with edge and node features (in example folder)

- variational autoencoder with MLP mapping functions (in example folder)

- implicit neural representation with sin activation (in example folder)

- net2net transfer learning (knowledge distillation)

- gradient surgury method for multi-objective optimization

- unsupervised learning based on the autoencoder architecture for tabular and time-series data

- supervised learning for tabular data regression and time-series forcasting

- Differentiable divergence and laplacian operators for vector and tensor fields (for PINN architecture)

- MLP, RNN, GRU

- AWS S3 client for cloud interaction
